# Do Taxi Drivers Take Fastest Route
 Analyizing taxi trips with the Routing API & Jupyter Notebook

In this tutorial, we use python 3 to:
1. Set up and display a basic TomTom Map
2. Using sample taxi trip data in a CSV file, display trips on the map
3. Use the TomTom Routing API to compare optimized routes to the Taxi trips
4. Make a few calculations to see what the average deviation is between the sampel data and the TomTom Routes
5. Display histograms, clusters, and colorized polylines to visualize differences and delays

To use the python code above, paste each section into the separat cells indicated.

To get started with Jupyter Notebook, check out their website, and then run jupyter-lab in your terminal to get going.

To use the notebook, start Jupyter lab and open it directly.

The data set used here, in the article, and referenced in the CSV is originally from Kaggle.https://www.kaggle.com/c/pkdd-15-taxi-trip-time-prediction-ii

Happy Mapping!
