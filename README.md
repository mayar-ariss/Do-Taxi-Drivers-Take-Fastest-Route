# Do Taxi Drivers Take Fastest Route
 Analyizing taxi trips with the Routing API & Jupyter Notebook

In this tutorial, we use python 3 to:
1. Set up and display a basic TomTom Map
2. Using sample taxi trip data in a CSV file, display trips on the map
3. Use the TomTom Routing API to compare optimized routes to the Taxi trips
4. Make a few calculations to see what the average deviation is between the sampel data and the TomTom Routes
5. Display histograms, clusters, and colorized polylines to visualize differences and delays
